# inventory
Inventory is an Android app for keeping track of storage with the option to organize it by categories and sort it by ascending or descending order.

When there're inventory items they're grouped into **2 sections - To buy and Enough** and sorted by ascending order - starting from **To buy** section starting with the items that least match the criteria to those close to enough **quantity-minQuantityTarget** moving to **Enough** section starting with the items that're least enough to those that are most enough. The descending sort option applies the same rules but in descending order.
